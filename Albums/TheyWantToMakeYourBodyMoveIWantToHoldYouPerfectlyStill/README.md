*“…The whole experience plays trick with your mind as time, perception and intonation morph into something new and frightening.”* - **[Sethmol Productions](sethmol.wordpress.com/2012/09/08/they-want-to-make-your-body-move/)** 

*" ...it’s super dark, super glitch(y) and super weird but all in a GOOD way"* - **[The Sirens Sound](www.thesirenssound.com/2012/09/12/schemawound/)**
